## 🍼 What is FetalCLIP

FetalCLIP is a vision-language foundation model designed specifically for fetal ultrasound image analysis. Unlike general-purpose models, FetalCLIP is pre-trained on 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text, making it the largest dataset of its kind used for foundation model development. By leveraging multimodal learning, FetalCLIP generates universal representations of fetal ultrasound imagery. This innovative approach allows FetalCLIP to capture essential anatomical information, yielding robust representations that can be applied to a variety of clinically relevant downstream tasks.

## 📝 Highlights
> **Abstract:** *Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.*

import open_clip
from PIL import Image

# Define paths for model configuration and weights
PATH_FETALCLIP_CONFIG = "FetalCLIP_config.json"
PATH_FETALCLIP_WEIGHT = "FetalCLIP_weights.pt"

# Set device to GPU (CUDA) for faster computation
device = torch.device("cuda")

# Load and register model configuration
with open(PATH_FETALCLIP_CONFIG, "r") as file:
    config_fetalclip = json.load(file)
open_clip.factory._MODEL_CONFIGS["FetalCLIP"] = config_fetalclip

# Load the FetalCLIP model and preprocessing transforms as well as tokenizer
model, preprocess_train, preprocess_test = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms("FetalCLIP", pretrained=PATH_FETALCLIP_WEIGHT)
tokenizer = open_clip.get_tokenizer("FetalCLIP")
model.eval()
model.to(device)

# List of input image file paths
images = ["image1.jpg", "image2.png", ...] # Replace with actual image file paths
# Preprocess images and stack them into a single tensor
images = torch.stack([preprocess_test(Image.open(img_path)) for img_path in images]).to(device)

# Define text prompts for classification
text_prompts = [
    "Ultrasound image focusing on the fetal abdominal area, highlighting structural development.",
    "Fetal ultrasound image focusing on the heart, highlighting detailed cardiac structures.",
    ...
] # Please refer to the text prompts in zero_shot_planes_db/
text_tokens = tokenizer(text_prompts).to(device) # Tokenize the text prompts

# Perform model inference
with torch.no_grad(), torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    # Encode text and images into feature vectors
    text_features = model.encode_text(text_tokens)
    image_features = model.encode_image(images)

    # Normalize feature vectors
    image_features /= image_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    text_features /= text_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)

    # Compute similarity scores (probabilities) between image and text features
    text_probs = (100.0 * image_features @ text_features.T).softmax(dim=-1)

print("Label probs:", text_probs)
```
